# Mishmash to achieve the Tao of the programming.

## Motivation:
I have a lot of code that I used to study. I thought it might be worth 
to share it because it shows the progress being made, also where other 
code on my github account doesn't show it.

## Rights:
There are always some.

## Requirements: 
python 3.9 - guess the rest.

## Remarks:
This is where you can find never-released Star Trek movies. You can 
see the inside of the black hole. You can also see some photos of the 
ancient aliens, and what is under the right paw of the Sphinx.

## Game Summary:
All this to achieve the Tao of the programming:

## Thanks:
I want to thank my beloved niece Dominika (she is 10 years old).

## Game Controls:    
You don't have a chance to control everything.

## Version:
This is version 1.00 of the Tao of the programming.
